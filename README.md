# Project description

This repository contains the scripts used to clean and process data for the data paper of Sentil et al. 2025, "_A Synthesized Dataset of Wild Bees and Hoverfly Occurrences in Europe_" based on spatial data of **wild bees** from the SAFEGUARD project. These scripts are designed to streamline data cleaning and transformation, making them easily reusable and adaptable for similar projects.

## Project funding
This work has been funded by:

**SAFEGUARD** (Safeguarding European wild pollinators). Horizon 2020 (No. 101003476). Task 1.1:  Compiling distributional data on European pollinators at EU and national levels.

**PULSE** (Providing technical and scientific support in measuring the pulse of European biodiversity using the Red List Index, contract No. 07.027755/2020/840209/SER/ENV.D.2.).

# Script description

This project includes several essential data cleaning steps to prepare spatial data of **wild bees** for analysis, including:


- **Data Import, Preprocessing, and Aggregation**: Importing raw data, cleaning it, and aggregating it for consistency.
- **Scientific Names Validation**: Ensuring that all species names are consistent with those used in Ghisbain et al. (2023).
- **Data Quality Check**: Identifying missing, erroneous, or outlier values in the dataset.
- **Taxonomic Assignment**: Assigning each species to its correct taxonomic rank (order, family, subfamily, tribes and subgenus).
- **Geographical Assignment**: Assigning administrative level (country, state province and county). 
- **Batch Mapping**: Automatically generating maps for each species based on geographic coordinates.

This project does **not** include steps such as:

- **Data Transformation and Normalization**: For scaling or transforming data values.
- **Data Encoding**: Encoding new data.
- **Spatial Data Validation**: Spatial data validation process in collaboration with expert taxonomists and national experts.

# Script requirements

To run the scripts, you'll need:

- R
- All the required packages listed in the `library.R` file

You can install the required packages by running the following command in your R console:

```R
source('install_packages.R')
```

# Usage
To use the scripts, simply follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running source('install_packages.R').
3. Prepare your dataset according to the format described in metadata documentation (metadata.csv).
4. Run the individual scripts in the same order. 
    - `01_data_import.R`
    - `02_quality_check.R`
    - `03_scientificName_validation.R`
    - `04_taxonomy_classification.R`
    - `05_administrative_level.R`
    - `06_batch_map.R`

5. Modify the scripts as needed for your specific dataset or research requirements.

# Data Sources and Attribution

The following external sources were used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset:

- **Scientific Name Validation**: Species names were verified using:
    > [Ghisbain, Rosa et al. (2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373048571_The_new_annotated_checklist_of_the_wild_bees_of_Europe_Hymenoptera_Anthophila): The new annotated checklist of the wild bees of Europe (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) (DOI: [10.11646/zootaxa.5327.1.1](https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5327.1.1).

- **Taxonomic Assignment**: The taxonomic ranks (family, subfamily, tribe, genus, and subgenus) were assigned based on: 
    > [Reverte, Milicic et al. (2023)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373865563): National records of 3000 European bee and hoverfly species: A contribution to pollinator conservation (DOI: [10.1111/icad.12680](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12680).
    Note : scientific names have been updated and standardized to match the European checklist (Ghisbain et al. 2023): _Hylaeus longimacula_ --> _Hylaeus longimaculus_, _Dioxys atlanticus_ --> _Dioxys atlantica_, _Dioxys cinctus_ --> _Dioxys cincta_, _Dioxys moestus_ --> _Dioxys moesta_, _Dioxys pumilus_ --> _Dioxys pumila_. Note2: two species (_Bombus bisiculus_ & _Seladonia pici_) are not present in the European checklist.

-  **Country and state province assignments**: The country and state province assignments were performed using shapefiles based on the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD):
